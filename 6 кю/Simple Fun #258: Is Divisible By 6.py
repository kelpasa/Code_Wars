Task
A masked number is a string that consists of digits and one asterisk (*) that should be replaced by exactly one digit. Given a masked number s, find all the possible options to replace the asterisk with a digit to produce an integer divisible by 6.

Input/Output
[input] string s

A masked number.

1 â‰¤ inputString.length â‰¤ 10000.

[output] a string array

Sorted array of strings representing all non-negative integers that correspond to the given mask and are divisible by 6.
